## Category 1: Swift Language & Internals (1-40)

1. **Q: What is the difference between `let` and `var`?**
   A: `let` defines a constant (immutable), while `var` defines a variable (mutable). Swift prefers `let` for safety.
2. **Q: What are value types vs. reference types?**
   A: Value types (struct, enum) copy data on assignment. Reference types (class) share a single instance.
3. **Q: Explain Optional and Optional Binding.**
   A: Optionals handle the absence of a value. We unwrap them using `if let` or `guard let`.
4. **Q: What is Nil Coalescing?**
   A: Using `??`（double question mark） to provide a default value if an optional is `nil`.
5. **Q: What is a Retain Cycle?**
   A: When two objects hold strong references to each other, preventing deallocation.
6. **Q: How does ARC work?**
   A: Automatic Reference Counting tracks the number of strong references to an object and deallocates it when the count reaches zero.
7. **Q: Difference between `weak` and `unowned`?**
   A: `weak` is optional and becomes `nil` when the object is gone. `unowned` is non-optional and crashes if accessed after deallocation.
8. **Q: What is Copy-on-Write (COW)?**
   A: An optimization for value types like Arrays where data is only copied when modified.
9. **Q: What is a Closure?**
   A: A self-contained block of code that can capture variables from its surrounding context.
10. **Q: Explain `@escaping` closures.**
    A: A closure that is called after the function returns, requiring explicit memory management.
11. **Q: What are Generics?**
    A: They allow writing flexible, reusable code that works with any type.
12. **Q: What is a Protocol?**
    A: A blueprint of methods or properties that a class, struct, or enum must implement.
13. **Q: What is a Protocol Extension?**
    A: It provides default implementations for protocol methods.
14. **Q: Explain the difference between `Self` and `self`.**
    A: `self` refers to the instance; `Self` refers to the type.
15. **Q: What is an Enum with Associated Values?**
    A: An enum where cases can store additional data of different types.
16. **Q: What is a Computed Property?**
    A: A property that doesn't store a value but provides a getter/setter to calculate one.
17. **Q: What is a Lazy Property?**
    A: A property initialized only when first accessed.
18. **Q: What is the difference between `Any` and `AnyObject`?**
    A: `Any` covers all types; `AnyObject` covers only classes.

23. **Q: Explain `final` keyword.**
    A: Prevents a class from being inherited or a method from being overridden.
24. **Q: What is a Designated Initializer vs Convenience Initializer?**
    A: Designated is the primary init; Convenience must call a designated init of the same class.

    A: A mechanism to handle errors thrown by functions.
28. **Q: What is `try?` vs `try!`?**
