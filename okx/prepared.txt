小影记
As a key iOS developer at Xiaoyingji (a popular video editing app with millions of users), I led a comprehensive stability and memory optimization initiative, resolving critical technical bottlenecks to enhance user experience—aligned with interview-focused clarity and conciseness.
Crash Optimization: Root-Cause Fixes
Systematically eliminated four major crash categories with targeted technical solutions:
1）Multi-thread Data Race: Implemented thread-safe mechanisms to resolve concurrent resource competition.
2）Memory Leak-induced Crashes: Fixed leaks via code refactoring and lifecycle management optimization.
3）Array Out-of-bounds Errors: Added strict bounds checking and safe index access logic.
4）Unrecognized Selector Errors: Leveraged Objective-C runtime message forwarding—intercepted forwardingTargetForSelector and dynamically added empty implementations for missing methods, eliminating unrecognized message crashes.

Memory Optimization: Reduced Footprint & Peak Usage
Executed a three-pronged strategy tailored for video editing’s high-memory demands:
1）Peak Memory Reduction: Wrapped memory-intensive batch processing tasks with @autoreleasepool to force  timely temporary object release.
2）Timely Resource Deallocation: Implemented strict lifecycle management to immediately free unused media assets and cached data.
3）Memory Leak Elimination: Used Instruments Leaks Tool to locate and fix hidden leaks.


同花顺
As a key iOS developer at Tonghuashun—China’s top stock trading platform (14M+ DAU, 90% securities firm integration)—I specialized in enterprise-grade stability systems and financial data visualization, focusing on crash resilience and real-time performance. My deep expertise in iOS crash capture principles from this role directly enabled effective crash analysis work at Dongchedi later.
Enterprise-Grade Crash Capture & Analysis System
Designed and built a full-stack crash monitoring system tailored for financial scenarios (downtime risks user investment losses), with in-depth implementation of core principles:
Core Capabilities
1）Dual-Level Crash Collection: Captured object-level uncaught exceptions (null pointers, logic errors) via Objective-C exception handlers; monitored system-level low-end crashes (SIGSEGV/SIGABRT/SIGBUS) via signal handlers, covering kernel-level failures.
2）Precise Symbolication Workflow: Collected critical debugging data (ASLR offsets, app base launch offsets, raw crash addresses); calculated actual code locations using Actual Address = Crash Address - ASLR Offset - Base Address; mapped to function names/line numbers via DSYM files for actionable root-cause analysis.
3）Contextual & Compliant Data Collection: Gathered non-sensitive user context (app version, device model, trading page) to accelerate debugging, fully complying with financial privacy regulations.
4）Smart Upload Strategy: Passive background sync on app restart (30s network polling for resilience); user-friendly prompts for non-critical errors, boosting log upload rate by 25%.


描述一件最成功/印象最深刻/最有成就感的事情
The most challenging problem was resolving months-long intractable online crashes in the Dongchedi dealer system. These crashes failed symbolization via standard tools (Xcode Organizer, Crashlytics), with logs only showing hexadecimal addresses instead of function names. Some crashes occurred exclusively on specific device-OS combinations and were unreproducible in test environments, affecting tens of thousands of daily users given Dongchedi’s scale.

To resolve this, I developed a proprietary manual symbolization workflow based on iOS low-level principles (ASLR, Mach-O structure, dSYM debug info), which later became the team’s standard practice:
1）Extract Crash Context: Collected core data (crash address, affected modules’ runtime base addresses) from monitoring platform crash reports—base addresses are auto-recorded in the "Binary Images" section.
2）Calculate Symbol Offset: Reversed ASLR with module-specific formulas: main app offset = crash address - main app runtime base address; framework offset = crash address - framework runtime base address, ensuring accurate binary mapping.
3）Precise Symbol Matching: Used version-matched dSYM files and symbolication tools to parse Symbol Table/DWARF info, translating offsets into exact function names and code lines—resolving standard tools’ failures.
4）Reproduce & Fix Root Causes: Leveraged ByteDance’s device farm to replicate target hardware-OS environments, injected context-inferred test data (e.g., abnormal business records) to trigger crashes. Fixed root causes (null pointers, invalid data handling) via targeted null checks and data validation.

Outcomes: Cut dealer system crash rate by 20%, reduced critical crash resolution time by 60%, documented the method in a Manual Crash Localization Guide and trained 15 team members. This work demonstrated my ability to apply low-level fundamentals to solve large-scale edge-case issues without relying on standard tools.
