仔细梳理自己简历中的工作经历、亮点项目以及成就
一.Core Achievements at Changan Auto
1）I led the ground-up componentization of the monolithic vehicle control module, refactoring it into a 3-layer architecture from scratch:
Foundation Layer: Network, storage and basic utilities
Common Layer: Shared capabilities, payment capabilities and user behavior collection
Business Layer: Remote vehicle control, Bluetooth key control and in-app shopping 

2)Designed a router based on runtime message forwarding.
The router stores component protocol definitions, 
dynamically creates protocol-conforming classes at runtime, 
and forwards messages through runtime to realize complete component decoupling.

二.Core Achievements at ByteDance
Migrated the B-side dealer module from the legacy MVC architecture to MVVM, enabling low coupling and long-term maintainability.
1)View Layer: Focuses on UI rendering and user interaction
2)ViewModel Layer: Processes user input actions and delivers business logic results to the View Layer
3)Model Layer: Defines standardized data models

三.Core Achievements at Kugou Music
I led the full reconstruction and optimization of the Friend Recommendation Page
1）Cut 40% of redundant code in the recommendation module, improving maintainability.
2）Accelerated recommendation data loading by 60%, Used Instruments Time Profile to identify lag caused by nested loops; replaced nested traversals with dictionary-based data caching to reduce time complexity.

四.Core Achievements at XiaoYing
At XiaoYing, as a key iOS developer, I led the crash and memory optimization work. 
1)First, for the multi-thread data race issue on the picture page, I implemented thread-safe mechanisms to fix concurrent resource contention. 
2)for Unrecognized Selector Errors, I used Objective-C runtime message forwarding—intercepting forwardingTargetForSelector: and adding empty implementations for missing methods to eliminate such crashes. 
3)I resolved memory leaks by refactoring code and optimizing lifecycle management, which fixed crashes caused by memory leaks.

五.Core Achievements at tonghuashun
I built a full-stack crash monitoring system tailored for financial scenarios.
1）Dual-Level Crash Collection: Captured object-level uncaught exceptionsvia Objective-C exception handlers; monitored system-level low-end crashes via signal handlers.

2）Collected critical debugging data (ASLR offsets, app base launch offsets, raw crash addresses); calculated actual code locations using Actual Address = Crash Address - ASLR Offset - Base Address; mapped to function names via DSYM file.


描述一件最成功/印象最深刻/最有成就感的事情
My Most Rewarding Achievement: Building Changan Auto’s iOS Componentization Ecosystem from Scratch
As the core iOS technical lead at Changan Automobile, my most impactful achievement is spearheading the end-to-end componentization transformation of the iOS engineering system from 2019 to present—a ground-up initiative that addressed critical pain points and delivered substantial long-term value.
The project began with a pressing challenge: Changan’s legacy iOS codebase was a monolithic structure, making it cumbersome to support the company’s expanding matrix of intelligent connected car apps. Cross-app feature reuse required massive redundant development, leading to 40% of engineering effort wasted on duplicate work, frequent version inconsistencies, and prolonged delivery cycles. Worse, the tightly coupled architecture made it nearly impossible to scale teams or onboard new developers efficiently.
To tackle this, I led the design and implementation of a scalable 3-tier component architecture:
Foundation Layer: Unified core infrastructure (network, storage, base utilities) to eliminate low-level duplication;
Common Business Layer: Centralized shared capabilities (authentication, vehicle binding, user management) for cross-app reuse;
Business Layer: Decoupled dedicated modules (vehicle control, status monitoring, remote operations) for independent iteration.
A key technical breakthrough was the runtime-based Router I designed: by storing component protocol definitions and dynamically creating conforming classes at runtime, we achieved full decoupling—components communicate via protocol IDs without direct dependencies, solving the long-standing issue of tight coupling in monolithic apps.
The outcome was transformative: we built a reusable vehicle control SDK that now powers 5 Changan Apps, cutting cross-app feature delivery time by 30% and slashing redundant code by over 60%. This not only saved hundreds of engineering hours annually but also laid the foundation for Changan’s matrixed app development strategy, enabling seamless scaling across new products. Additionally, I developed a comprehensive training program to upskill 20+ team members on componentization best practices, fostering a more efficient, collaborative engineering culture.
To this day, this componentization ecosystem remains the backbone of Changan’s iOS development, driving consistent stability, accelerating innovation, and delivering enduring business value—making it the most fulfilling and impactful work of my career.



描述一件最困难/最有挑战性的事情是如何解决的
The most challenging problem I faced was fixing the long-standing online crashes in the Dongchedi dealer system. Standard tools couldn’t symbolize these crashes — the logs only showed hex addresses, not function names. This affected tens of thousands of daily users.
To fix this, I created a custom manual symbol fix process based on basic iOS principles. Later, this became the team’s standard way of working:

1.Get crash key info: Collect core data like crash address and base address from the monitoring platform’s crash reports, the base address is in the "Binary Images" section.
2.Calculate symbol offset: 
main app offset = crash address - main app runtime base address;
framework offset = crash address - framework runtime base address.
3.Find the exact symbol: Use dSYM files matching the app version and symbol tools to read the Symbol info, and turn offsets into exact function names.

In the end, I reduced the dealer system’s crash rate by 20%. I also wrote this method into a Manual Crash Localization Guide and trained 30 team members to use it.


根据职位的描述，面试官可能会预设一个具体的场景，回答应对办法
如何安全的保存用户的私钥
To securely store users' private keys on iOS, we use Secure Enclave—a separate, tamper-proof hardware component in Apple’s chips (A-series/M-series).
Its core principle: Private keys never leave the Secure Enclave in plaintext. All encryption/signing happens directly in this isolated hardware, so keys aren’t exposed to the app’s memory or iOS system—even if the device is jailbroken.
Basic workflow:
Generate a key pair in Secure Enclave (private key stays here);
Use the public key to encrypt the user’s private key, store encrypted data in Keychain;
When needed, decrypt and use the private key inside Secure Enclave, then clear it from memory.
Adding FaceID/TouchID for verification makes it even safer.


专业相关问题的简单讨论
What is the composition of the object structure in OC?
It is composed of an isa pointer and property pointers. The isa pointer consists of many properties, such as has_assoc, weak_referenced, extra_rc, and has_sidetable_rc. Although the isa pointer contains a wealth of information, it only occupies 8 bytes, which improves the efficiency of OC.

What situations can cause a deadlock?
The main reason is two tasks waiting for each other! For example, when we create a task on a synchronous queue while the queue is executing another task, a deadlock will occur.
This is the most common scenario we encounter. We should always ask ourselves: is the task we are creating waiting for another task? This mostly happens in a synchronous queue!


Why does Swift design Copy on Write?
Swift uses value type syntax to use arrays, but saves the data on the heap. It automatically manages the copying of arrays.

Copy on Write is an optimization technique for arrays.All the properties share the same data while the arrays have no changes.Only when the data is changed and the array has a reference count greater than one, it will copy the data to a new pointer.The optimized array has some features:

1._buffer: points to the address of the data on the heap.
2.refcount: reference count
3.isUnique
4.Elements: the address of the elements on the heap.
5.Count: the number of elements.

Flutter has the same declarative UI syntax as SwiftUI: both describe what the UI looks like. 
Flutter uses `setState` to notify of changes, while SwiftUI uses `@State`/`@Binding` to observe changes; 
finally, Flutter calls the `build` function to refresh the UI, and SwiftUI calls the `body` property to refresh the UI. 

What is Metal? How is it different from OpenGL ES on iOS?
Metal is Apple’s high performance graphics engine which uses the GPU directly. Metal uses MTLDevice to get a GPU reference, and renders on MTKView. We use asynchronous threads to process the data, and use MTLBuffer to send drawing data from the CPU to the GPU. This makes the UI interaction fluent.
 Compared to OpenGL ES: Metal is more efficient (closer to GPU), runs faster on Apple devices, and is better optimized for their chips. OpenGL ES is cross-platform but less tailored to Apple’s hardware, so it’s slower in comparison.
