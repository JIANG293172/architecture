1.use let for constant immultable property, use var for variable multable proerpty

2.value type use copy-on-write on assignment, while reference type share the same instance.

3.optional means the value can be exist or nil, we can use if let to unwrap it, or guart let for earaly exit.

4.ues double question mark to provide a default value if the optional is nil.

5.when tow objects hold strong reference form each others. perventing deallocation.

6.automatic reference counting tracks the number of strong references to an object and dallocates it when count reaches zero.

7.weak is optional; the object will be set to nil when deallocated. unowned is non-optional; accessing the object after it is deallocated will cause a crash.

8.copy-on-write is an optimization for value type in swift, copy the struct only when modified and refercount is greater than one, struct hold some properties: refercount elements count buffer, pointer the memoery in heap.

9.A closure is an implicit function; it can capture variables from its surrounding context, and a closure is connected to a pointer to the executable function code, the captured variables, and a flag to mark whether it is an escaping closure.

10.a closure is called after the function returns, requiring clarity memory management.

11.what are generics?
they allow writing flexible, reusable code that works with any teyps.

12.a blueprint of methods or properties that a class, struct or enum, must implement.
swift protocol provide more functions, protocol extension provide default implementions and computed properties.

13.protocol extension provide a defalut implementions for protocol.

14.self refer to the instance, Self refer to the Type.

15.enum associated values: the enum case can store additional data of different types.

16.computed property: a perpery that doesn‘t store value but provide get/set to calculate one.

17.lazy property: a object  be initialized  when first accessed.

18.Any, AnyObject： any is refer to Any type, AnyObject is refer to classes.

19.defer: it ensure a closure code runs after levaving the scope.

20.tuple: a grouping of multiple values into a single cmobined value

21. Type aliascing: giving a new name to an existing type for clarity.

22.failable initializer: an init that can reture nil if initializarion fials.

23. final keyword: prevents a class from being inherited or a method from being overridden.

24.designated is primary init, convenience initializer must call a designanted init for the same class.

25.what is singleton
a pattern ensuring a class has only one instance with a global pointer of accesss.

26.error protocol is a type representing values that can be thrown as errors.
